# Improved-k-NN-Breast-Cancer-Classification
This research aims to propose the implementation of feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination with cross-validation (RFECV) could optimise the novel k-NN classification model to classify the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset which is based on the FNA technique with a more accurate, higher precision and better sensitivity.
